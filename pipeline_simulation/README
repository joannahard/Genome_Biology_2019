All rules files and snakefiles have a symlink in the directory where the analysis is run:

/media/box2/Experiments/Joanna/Simulering/pipeline

To run the pipeline, the conda "snake2" has all requirements.

# run full pipeline to merged stats matrix:
source activate snake2
snakemake -p -j 80 merge_stats_all


# some target rules:

- all - will exectute all the steps for conbase,sccaller and monovar. Lira is not included in the all rule.
- all_conbase - run all steps of conbase
- all_gatk - preprocessing with gatk for lira
- all_sim - create all simulation datasets.
- all_lira - run all steps of lira
- all_monovar
- all_sccaller
