All symlinks were made to all rules files and snakefiles in the directory where the analysis is run:

/media/box2/Experiments/Joanna/Simulering/pipeline - for simulated depth at each allele
/media/box2/Experiments/Joanna/Simulering/pipeline2 - for flat depth

To run the pipeline, the conda "snake2" has all requirements.

# run full pipeline to merged stats matrix:
source activate snake2
snakemake -p -j 80 merge_stats_all


# the 2 configfiles are:
- config_pipeline.yaml - simulated depth
- config_pipeline_flat.yaml - flat depth at 30

# some target rules:
- all - will exectute all the steps for conbase,sccaller and monovar. Lira is not included in the all rule.
- all_conbase - run all steps of conbase
- all_gatk - preprocessing with gatk for lira
- all_sim - create all simulation datasets.
- all_lira - run all steps of lira
- all_monovar
- all_sccaller


# summary plotting script is not included in pipeline, they are included in folder scripts/R/
