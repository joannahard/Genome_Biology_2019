# Scripts for plotting stats from simulation

File plot_simulation_stats_each_ds.R - contains a function for plotting each dataset separately and creating an Rdata file with all stats.
Was run with:
plot_simulation_stats_each_ds("lira",flat=T)
plot_simulation_stats_each_ds("conbase",flat=T)
plot_simulation_stats_each_ds("conbase",flat=F)
Etc for all datasets and both flat=T & flat=F

# merged plots were created with script:
plot_simulation_stats_merged.R


OBS! all folders are hardcoded in the scripts, output from the pipeline with flat_dp and sim_dp were copied to separate folders.
